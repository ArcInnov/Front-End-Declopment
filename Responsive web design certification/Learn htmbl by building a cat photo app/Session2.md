img element( a self closing tag)
You can add images to your website by using the img element. img elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. A tag for an element without a closing tag is known as a self-closing tag.

Html attributes
HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior. The src attribute in an img element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located). An example of an img element using an src attribute: <img src="https://www.your-image-source.com/your-image.jpg">.
You should always add the link in double quotaions 

alt atrribute
All img elements should have an alt attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load
Alt atrttribute's value should albo enclosed withing double quotaions

anchor element
You can link to another page with the anchor (a) element. For example, <a href='https://freecodecamp.org'></a> would link to freecodecamp.org
At this stage it is not diplayed in preview

Link text 
A link's text must be placed between the opening and closing tags of an anchor (a) element. For example, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org</a> is a link with the text click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org.
